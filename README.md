# language-reason package

Syntax highlighting for the [Reason](https://github.com/facebook/reason) language. If you're using Atom and have already installed Nuclide, this one's unnecessary.

This is the source of truth for our syntax regex-based highlighting. Hopefully Sublime, Atom, VSCode and the rest all use this same one or derive the highlighting from it. The latter two already do so.
